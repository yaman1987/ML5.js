# ml5.js
### PoseNet online deployment using ml5.js

ml5.js is used to deploy machine learning in the web (it makes use of the web browser's built in graphics processing unit (GPU) to do calculations that would otherwise run very slowly using central processing unit (CPU) based calculations). <br>

In this example, I used Google ml5.js and p5.js to quikly deploy online the pre-trained PoseNet model. PoseNet is a vision model that can be used to estimate the pose of a person in an image or video by estimating where key body joints are. <br>

A live demonstration of this code working is available [here](https://pierpaolo28.github.io/Projects/ml5.js/ml5intro.html). <br>

In order to realise this project I made use of the following references:
